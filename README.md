# SimpleWater.py
SimpleWater.py is a water system that allows dynamics waves and interaction. Using hooke's law and a line of points joined by springs you can create a semi-realistic looking water system that can react to user input or if used correctly, can be used in a game and interact with object.




Simply install pygame and run SimpleWater.py.
